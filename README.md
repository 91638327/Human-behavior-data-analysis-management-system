VII. Introduction.

Human behavior data analysis management system is academic service software mainly serving subjects of sociology, history, political science, psychology, and anthropology. The main service groups are students, professors, and researchers of related majors. This software can be used for fast and convenient data analysis management and is equipped with system management, system configuration, data analysis, problem reminder, reports of human behavior, and etc. In addition, there is a system setting function to carry out the operation of human behavior data analysis management system according to the set configuration parameters. The software follows the event bus mode. The message source publishes messages to a specific channel on the event bus. The listener subscribes to a specific channel, is notified of the message, and offers timely notification of service. New publishers, subscribers, and connections can be easily added, which are valid for this highly distributed application.


VIII. Technical Features.

The event-driven architecture makes the event processors highly decoupled from each other, and the software scales well because of the asynchronous nature of events, and the software is not easily blocked.
